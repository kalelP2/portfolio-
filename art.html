        <p class="description">I went to my Aunts Emt party cookout and they had chalk and a open concrete floor.
            So i drew my favorite JJK character Itadori. It took 15 minutes and it was fun to draw because i dont usually draw outside for everyone to see unless in my sketchbook.

            He set up a art exchange and we both drew Gojo from JJK. We both drew it good, but she drew on a canvas and painted it i just used a big piece of paper and markers.
            But it was a fun experience to do a art exchange with someone who is as good or if not better than me at art. </p>

        <p class="description">This picture is of me. My teacher Ms Cruz told me that I could design the school so I drew me because I was thinking they could make an individual sweater for every senior student in the school. 
            But they are doing general sweaters for all of the senior students. So I will keep this to make my own senior sweater. </p>
