        Hey, I'm Kalel Page-Allan. I am a student at Thomas A Edison Career and Technical Education High School, and I am in my senior year.

    <div class="wave" id="overwatch">
        <h1>Overwatch</h1>
       <p>
    I play Overwatch a lot. I think it is the best game I have because it offers so many ways to play and experiment with different characters. I primarily play DPS when I want to get the most kills and assists, as it lets me carry the game in a fast-paced, action-packed way. The DPS characters I play are Hanzo, Soldier 76, Reaper, Genji, Cassidy, Ashe, Echo, Sombra, Mei, and Bastion. Hanzo’s precision and mobility, Soldier 76’s balanced playstyle, and Reaper's high sustain in close quarters make them my go-to choices. Sombra’s hacking abilities allow me to disrupt the enemy’s plans, while Mei offers crowd control and area denial. Each of these characters brings something unique to the team, and I enjoy finding new strategies with them.
</p>
<p>
    I play Overwatch because I think it is fun and I like the gameplay variety. I get a thrill from trying out different tactics depending on the map and the situation. I play Tank when I want to feel invincible and charge in with my healers supporting me. The Tank role allows me to take on the frontline, create space, and protect my teammates. I like to play D.Va, Junker Queen, Orisa, Roadhog, Sigma, Zarya, Ramattra, Winston, and Wrecking Ball. D.Va’s mobility and defense matrix make her perfect for blocking incoming damage while engaging enemies, while Ramattra’s versatility allows me to adapt to different situations. Zarya’s energy-based damage scaling and Winston’s dive tactics offer dynamic approaches to controlling objectives and engaging in team fights. Each Tank hero provides something distinct, and I enjoy playing each one depending on the team's needs.
</p>
<p>
    I play support when I want to heal my teammates and keep them alive during intense fights. The Support role is crucial for ensuring your team stays at full health, allowing them to keep pushing forward. I like to play Support because I enjoy healing and making sure my team performs at its best, especially when the stakes are high. I play Ana, Baptiste, Mercy, Moira, Kiriko, Lucio, Zenyatta, and Brigitte. Ana’s healing potential and anti-healing grenade are incredibly effective at controlling the flow of the fight, while Mercy’s damage boost and mobility help me keep my team alive and at their best. Moira’s self-sustain and area healing are great for hectic situations, while Kiriko offers a blend of healing and protection. Lucio is excellent for providing speed boosts and environmental control, while Zenyatta and Brigitte provide strong utility with their debuffs and healing abilities. Each of these heroes allows me to make a significant impact on my team’s success, and I enjoy the challenge of balancing healing and utility.

        <h1>Anime</h1>
        <p>
            I love anime because it is entertaining and fun. I like to watch anime when I'm bored or when I want to watch something new. I enjoy introducing others to anime because I like to see people enjoy the things I love. I've watched over 100 anime series, and while I can’t remember all of them, if I see one again, I probably remember and rewatch it. My favorite anime are *Jujutsu Kaisen*, *Horimiya*, and *Dandadan*.
        </p>

        <p>
            My favorite romance anime is *Horimiya*. I enjoy it because it's relatable, fun, and the romance and characters feel authentic. The art style is also great.
            <br>
            <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> <br>
            *Horimiya* is a Japanese manga series by HERO. It follows Hori Kyouko and Miyamura Izumi, two high school students who seem very different at first but discover they have more in common than expected. The series delves into their relationship, as well as themes of friendship, identity, and acceptance.

            I recently started watching *Dandadan*, and it quickly became a favorite. I love its mix of supernatural elements, action, and quirky humor.
            <br>
            <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> <br>
            *Dandadan* follows high school students Momo Ayase and Ken Takakura, who both have unique interests—one in aliens and the other in ghosts. They team up on a bet to prove their beliefs, only to end up encountering both aliens and ghosts, leading to wild adventures. The series is known for its intense action scenes, humor, and exploration of friendship and self-acceptance.

        <h1>Art</h1>
        <p>
            I like art because it's fun and I enjoy drawing. I started drawing because I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z with my dad, who used to draw it all the time. After practicing for five years, I began to get better, drawing manga and anime art from what I see others create. Although my original art style is a bit more cartoony, I've been working toward an anime art style similar to Jujutsu Kaisen.

            I've been practicing volleyball for about two years now. I started playing for fun, inspired by my mom, who played in high school and won tournaments.
