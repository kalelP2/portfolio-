      <br>    "Jujutsu Kaisen" is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It follows the story of Yuji Itadori, a high school student with impressive physical abilities, who becomes involved in the world of sorcery and curses after encountering a cursed object.

          The story begins when Yuji, a member of his school's Occult Club, comes into contact with a powerful cursed object known as a "Sukuna's Finger." When his friends accidentally unleash the curse contained within the object, Yuji ingests it to protect them. However, this act causes him to become the host of Sukuna, a powerful and malevolent curse.

          As a result, Yuji is recruited by Megumi Fushiguro, a sorcerer from the Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College (Jujutsu High), to join the school and learn how to control and exorcise curses. Despite his initial reluctance, Yuji agrees to join in order to prevent Sukuna from causing further harm to innocent people.

          Throughout the series, Yuji trains alongside his classmates, including the cold and mysterious Nobara Kugisaki and the skilled but eccentric Satoru Gojo, who serves as their teacher and mentor. Together, they confront various curses and supernatural threats, while also uncovering the dark secrets of the sorcery world.

          "Jujutsu Kaisen" is known for its intense action scenes, complex characters, and intricate world-building. It explores themes such as the nature of curses, the consequences of power, and the value of friendship and sacrifice. The series has garnered widespread acclaim from both fans and critics alike, and it has been adapted into an anime series, which has further popularized the franchise.

          a short summary of it 
          <br>
          <br>
          "Classroom of the Elite" is a Japanese light novel series written by Shōgo Kinugasa and illustrated by Shunsaku Tomose. The story is set in a prestigious high school called Kodo Ikusei Senior High School, where students are provided with top-notch facilities and resources to foster their development and success.

          The series follows the protagonist, Kiyotaka Ayanokōji, a seemingly indifferent and unassuming student who enrolls in Kodo Ikusei Senior High School. Despite his initial lack of motivation, Kiyotaka possesses exceptional intellect and analytical skills, which he keeps hidden from others.

          At Kodo Ikusei, the students are divided into four classes—Class A to Class D—based on their academic performance and achievements. Class A consists of the top-performing students, while Class D comprises the lowest-performing students. The school operates on a unique system where students are given points that can be used to purchase various privileges and benefits, such as access to better facilities or exemption from certain tasks.

          As Kiyotaka navigates his way through the school, he forms relationships with his classmates, including Suzune Horikita, a highly ambitious and competitive student determined to climb the ranks of the school's hierarchy, and Kikyō Kushida, a friendly and sociable girl who hides her true intentions behind a cheerful facade.

          Throughout the series, Kiyotaka and his classmates find themselves entangled in various challenges and competitions orchestrated by the school's administration. These challenges often test their intellect, resourcefulness, and interpersonal skills, as they strive to outmaneuver their rivals and achieve their goals.

          "Classroom of the Elite" explores themes such as social hierarchy, meritocracy, and the pursuit of success. It blends elements of mystery, psychological drama, and slice-of-life, creating a compelling narrative that keeps readers engaged. The series has been adapted into manga and anime adaptations, further expanding its popularity among audiences.
