We instantly connected and talking about Dragon Ball z and video games. We dont hang out much afterschool but in school we are always hanging out and going on side quest. One of my favorite memories of us is going to hamiltion the broadway show for Us history. We got to travel to the city on the train one of my first times taking the train without my family. After that trip i went on disney + and started binging hamiliton (ive currently watche it 10 times from start to finish.) We also went on trip to World Trade Center together another trip we took the train together.  </p>
