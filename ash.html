        <h1>Welcome to The page about Ash and I </h1>
    </header>
  <section>
      <p>This is a page all about Ash and I. We have been together for 1 year and 7 months going on 2 years on april first. 
          Before I met her i was really boring and didnt do anything extra cricular (for example After school activities like art club, poetry, and Volleyball).
          She is into cheer and dance currently on the dance team for our school. So I wanted to dedicate this page to her for motivating and pushing me to be better   </p>

<h2>Her -Kalel Original Poem </h2>
Her 
   <br>       
I love her even tho she doesn’t love herself 
<br>
          I love her big eyes she says she doesn’t like 
<br>
          I love her small nose even tho she says it’s big 
<br>
          I love her lips even tho she says they are always dry 
<br>
          I love her small structure even tho she wishes she was taller 
<br>
          I love her baby arms even tho she says they aren’t 
<br>
          I love her small hands even tho she says they aren’t small 
<br>
          I love her small belly even tho she says she’s fat 
<br>
          I love her baby feet even tho she says they aren’t 
<br>
          I love her 
<br>
          And only her 
<br>
          Her 
<br>
          Her 
<br>
