        <p> This is the second app challenge we did. This social issue we did is about Emotions. We did emotions because people dont know how to control their emotions. They end up feeling isolated and alone. So our app is to connect people that have problems with their emotions. In our app you can talk to new people who have the same issues and make new friends or you can talk to mentor's/therapist. We have a minigame where you play as a smiley face and eat the angry faces and after you eat them all you win.</p>

        <p> This is our group project. We signed up to a Infosys app challenge and had to create a app based off of a social issue. We chose the topic of Future careers. We want to help young people find jobs they like and are good. We want to give them a easier way of signing up for jobs </p>

         <p> This was one of our first trinket projects. For this project we just had to create a drawing of anything. I created kirby because it is something simple and I think he is a cool character. </p>
